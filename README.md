# EmergeLibrary
An Library of gentoo stage4's proving an bootable system but modified with things like DE.

## Introduction

Hello If you do not know me I am Xinc (on discord) and i would like to provide bootable gentoo stage4's to allow people who do not want to bother compiling or want to expierence gentoo without any bother an gentoo stage4 would be probably your best bet!

An stage4 can work by simply extracting it and doing a few modifications depending on your case.

## Installation

Firstly, make sure to mount your root partition to /mnt/gentoo than make sure you had downloaded your stage4 to /mnt/gentoo.

Than run where the script is chmod 755 stage4install.sh

Than edit stage4install2.sh when the first script is done and edit the "mount /dev/sdc3 /boot/efi" command by replacing the /dev/sdc3 with your ESP partition.

And make sure to have nothing in /mnt/gentoo except the stage4.

Than go ahead and download the stage4install.sh script and run it as root and than when it is done run chmod 755 stage4install2.sh than "./install stage4install2.sh" and when it is done please enjoy the stage4's.

Note:
This installation guide only includes the additional steps of using the scripts stuff like editing fstab will not be documented.
Another note these scripts are originally created by TheSonicMaster or more specifically https://github.com/TheSonicMaster/  the script was just modified.

## How do i create stage4's?

Run everything as root below:

I first mount the root partition at /mnt/gentoo and you go into that directory and run mksquashfs /mnt/gentoo file.sfs -b 131072 -comp xz and to extract you run unsquashfs file.sfs where the file is located.
